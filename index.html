            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>FEB 2020: HTML 5</h3>
            <p>
              The journey into coding had to start somewhere, so from nothing I
              began to learn basic HTML
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>FEB 2020: CSS 3</h3>
            <p>
              Pretty much hand in hand with HTML I learnt CSS and began to put
              together some very rough, basic pages
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h3>
              <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> FEB 2020: Grid, Flexbox, SASS
            </h3>
            <p>
              Still in February and I'd got onto some more in-depth features of
              CSS, before moving onto SASS. Which is great.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>MAR 2020: Basic JS</h3>
            <p>
              Finally, onto a bit of functionality! Nothing very complicated,
              but I wanted to learn the basics before moving on to more complex
              JS and other frameworks and libraries
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>MAR 2020: Bootstrap 4</h3>
            <p>
              Finding out about different libraries was a gamechanger, I'll
              probably never write the code from scratch for a navbar ever
              again!

              <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>APR-AUG 2020: Javascript
            </h3>
            <p>
              Having got to grips with CSS and the basic theory of Javascript,
              it was time to take a deep dive into Vanilla JS. The more I
              learnt, the less I realised I knew...
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>AUG 2020: Node JS</h3>
            <p>
              While learning JS I touched on a bit of JQuery among many other
              things, but it was when I began using Node JS that things really
              started coming together - the use of different APIs and node
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>AUG 2020: React</h3>
            <p>
              Time to start learning some frameworks, and it seems React would
              be the best place to start. Maybe Vue will be next...
